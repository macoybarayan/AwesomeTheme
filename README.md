Awesome Theme - Wordpress Starter Theme
===

Hi. I'm a starter theme called `Awesome Theme`. You can use me as a starter theme for your custom Wordpress Theme. 

WHAT's INSIDE?
----------------

1. Built in Foundation 6 framework
2. Custom Metabox 2
3. Has Theme Options
4. Basic sections like Homepage Slider, Header, Footer, Contact Pages and Default pages


I'm just your starter theme so you can modify me whatever you want me to look like. Feel free to work around.


Thanks,
